## Introduction
This program is made to organize students by their first name, last name, age, birthday, school and much more. <br/>
All of the student will be put in .txt file automatically. <br/>
It is very simple to use and modify the result. <br/>
**THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**

## Installation
First of all, clone the repository. <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/Soofiaaa/student-organizer` <br/>
**MORE WILL BE ADDED TO THE INSTALLATION PROCESS**

## Future
New content will be online very soon. <br/>
As I said, this is still in development and I am still working on it.
It is currently not working right now since I worked on the student only.

## Question
If anybody has questions or suggestions about the program, feel free to contact me. <br/>
